1) Based on what you want, copy one of the provided .int files into your Fallout/DATA/SCRIPTS folder:

*  "RESET Default"'s obj_dude.int will reset all invasion dates to their default values
   This means Boneyard will be invaded 90 days after running this hack, and so on.

*  "Turn OFF"'s obj_dude.int will set all Days Left tickers to 64000, effectively disabling all invasions.


2) Once you've copied the version of obj_dude.int you would like into the Fallout/DATA/SCRIPTS folder, run your game

3) Right-click on the hero (yourself) and select the Binoculars

4) You will get a system message and floating message advising that the change has completed

5) Go into Pipboy and rest for 10 minutes

6) Save your game

7) have fun ;)


==TROUBLESHOOTING==

This will NOT reset towns that have already been invaded. To do that, you will need to obtain a copy of the map from a save slot where it's uninvaded.
For example, getting LAADYTUM.SAV from a savegame where Adytum's residents are still living.
Then you would copy that into the game you're wanting to run this hack on, then run the hack.
So basically you are restoring the town and then disabling it from being invaded again.
