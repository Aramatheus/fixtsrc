This file contains the Fallout end game patch, cheater utility and source code (Noid's compiler format).

Changes 17-3-2004

- Added a fix to Razor.int which caused Razor (the leader of the Blades) to bring up the wrong dialog if you have been to Adytum and talked to any of the Regulators.

- Added two reference text files listing script and critter prototype IDs.

- Added five new generic recruitable npc scripts; these can be assigned to spawned critters from the 'Spawn Generic NPC' function, the new scripts are:

  SID 965 - Genmerc: Generic mercenary, has full dialog options.

  SID 966 - Genpet: Generic Pet, can be assigned to dogs, rats, deathclaws, etc.  No dialog options, talking to critter will either add or remove it to your party.

  SID 967 - Genbot: Generic Robot, has full dialog options, need to use repair skill on critter to add to your party.

  SID 968 - Broinvar: Brotherhood Crack Assault Paladin, this is just a modified version of the original script; no dialog options, just floaters; talking to npc will either add or remove to your party.

  SID 969 - Folinvar: Follower invader, modified version of the original script; talks only in floaters; talking will either add or remove npc to your party.

To apply the patches simply unzip the file to the Fallout folder with 'Use folder names' option checked.

Enjoy.
