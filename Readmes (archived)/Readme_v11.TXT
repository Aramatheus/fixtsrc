(1.0) INTRODUCTION
------------------
This patch will upgrade Fallout version 1.0 to version 1.1.  Users 
of Fallout version 1.1 or later should not apply this patch.  To 
determine which version of Fallout you have, run Fallout and look 
in the lower right corner of the Fallout main menu screen for the 
version number.

The Fallout website will contain the latest patches and fixes.  We 
recommend that you check there before installing this patch for the 
absolute latest updates.
                                   http://www.interplay.com/fallout

In addition to fixing many minor script bugs, this patch fixes the 
following problems:

  - You can no longer get duplicate copies of the same NPC in 
    your party.

  - Armor now correctly adjusts your stats when being moved around 
    in your inventory.

  - Surviving exposure to radiation no longer raises your stats.

  - The autorun program will no longer attempt to load while the 
    game is playing.

This patch will not invalidate your saved games, however any saved
game which has already been corrupted will not be fixed by installing
this patch.  For example, if you have a saved game which contains the
duplicate-NPC bug, loading that saved game after installing this patch
will not remove the duplicate NPC's from your party.



------------------
(2.0) INSTALLATION
------------------
Copy the file FALL11.ZIP into the directory that Fallout is 
installed to.

Decompress the FALL11.ZIP file using any common file decompression
program such as PKUNZIP or WinZip.  Be sure extract the files using 
the option to include subdirectories (-d when using PKUNZIP).  Answer 
'yes' when prompted to overwrite existing files.

After the files have been decompressed, you can delete the FALL11.ZIP 
file from your Fallout directory.
