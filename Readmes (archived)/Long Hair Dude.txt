Long Hair Dude mod v1.1

By: x'il and Josan12 with expert help from Mash and Brother Soifran. 

This mod adds new player character model that has long hair (based on the Ian critter). 

Included in this package is Mash's "Hero Appearance mod" which allows for appearance selection on the game's character creation screen. (Big thanks to Mash!).

Refer to the Hero Appearance mod read-me file for installation instructions.

**You need to have Timeslip's sfall 2.0c or better**

Note on the animations: 

a) This mod only affects the player model up to Leather Armor. Metal Armor has it's own unique look. From Combat Armor onward, the game uses the generic hero model. 
b) Since the female model already has long hair, there is no change for it.:p
c) A word of warning: though all of the animations have been gone over for polishing several times, do not expect unreasonable levels of perfection!!


Enjoy!!
