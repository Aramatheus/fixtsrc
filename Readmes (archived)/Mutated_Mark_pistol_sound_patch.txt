file "WAE1XXX1" had a much to loud volume output, since repacking 
after extracting resulted in some issues I took another pistol 
soundfile and have overwritten the WAE1XXX1 file replacing it that way.
As far as I know the weapons 14mm and .223 rifle modified uses this sound 
sample.

now the extra loud (to loud) pistol/rifle sounds won't be heard, instead
a better fitting soundvolume sample is in.

simply extract the DATA folder in your Fallout 1 Directory, done.
