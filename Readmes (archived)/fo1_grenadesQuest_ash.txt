When i was playing Fallout patched with Fixt 5.2a i noticed that BOS grenades quest is broken.
You get the grenades from Michael but Sophia doesn't react, making it impossible to complete the quest.
So i decided to fix it. Sophia's dialogue messages were already there, and i just added one line to Michael's dialogue.
The logic/algorithm was missing, so i tried to restore it according to the dialogue messages. Hope you like it)

So now you have one more quest to do )

--------------Install----------------------
Put .int files into Fallout\data\Scripts\
Put .msg file into Fallout\data\TEXT\ENGLISH\DIALOG\
Yes, overwrite existing files.

No need to start a new game, the quest will work in a saved game.
If you have already talked to Michael - try going to 3rd floor, or to the bunker entrance and then back to Michael.

--------------Translation------------------
Replace new line in Michael.msg - {300}

--------------Technical stuff--------------
Used GVAR 303 (304 - quest for Power Armor), checked with gvar database on teamx.ru, seems to be free.
Compiled with sslc_f1.exe (23.04.2007)

\src\ folder contains .ssl files if you need to modify them.
