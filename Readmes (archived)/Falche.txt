Installation:

Copy this editor into your Fallout folder and run it.

If you're running this editor in MSDOS mode, you will need a DPMI
server like QEMM or CWSDPMI. You can get CWSDPMI at
ftp://ftp.simtel.net/simtelnet/gnu/djgpp/v2misc/csdpmi4b.zip

Win95 users need not bother with CWSDPMI, the editor will run as is.


Description:

This is a character editor for Interplay's Fallout which can edit
your character stats, perks, skills and more.

Before using this editor, you should make a backup of the savegame you
intend to edit just in case something bad happens. This editor modifies
SAVE.DAT only.

Also note that the editor does not limit the values you may enter in
certain fields. Don't expect the game to work reasonably if you enter
unreasonable values.


Known Bugs/Features:

- The age displayed shows the age of your character at the start of the
game and not the current age.

- Changes in stats due to certain perks, traits, radiation, addiction
and injuries are not taken into account. Thus the stats you see in the
game may not correspond to the ones in the editor.

- The editor won't work on games saved in combat mode.


Availability:

This editor will always be available at its homepage at
