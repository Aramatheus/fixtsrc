Fallout 3rd level of the Cathedral crash fix



About

There are some variations of the broken Fallout distributions spread across
the Internet which crash while player tries to enter the lowest (3rd)
level of the Cathedral. Crashes are caused by the corruption of master.dat
and critter.dat files. Current fix designed to correct corrupted data files.



Compatibility

This fix can be applied to US releases v1.0 and v1.1 with the following
MD5 hash values for the main data files:

critter.dat   4F6B9784411B92BEBB622C81ED720DAE
master.dat    0F173D86D623BB2F60DC741A4EE8B7BB

Patcher could run under any of MS/PC/DR-DOS 5.0+, Windows 4.0+, Windows NT 5.0+.



Application

 1. Make at least Large installation of the game.
 2. Unpack fix contents into the game installation directory.
 3. Run patch.bat.
 4. There should two 'Success' messages appear.
 5. If they don't send me console messages log. Go to step 9.
 6. If you have Fallout v1.1 download and REinstall the official patch v1.1.
 7. Load your saved game and check level 3 for problems.
 8. If the problem persists contact me for further assistance. Go to step 9.
 9. Delete patch.cmd file and patch directory.
10. End of the algorithm.



Notes

Corrupted distributions that we have tested had broken PDF manual as well.
That file is NOT covered with the fix. You have do download it separately
if needed.

Choose MD5 calculation utility carefully. Some of the programs available
on the Internet return erroneous results. HashTab is recommended. Program
